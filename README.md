## Introduction

This repository contains the codebase for a project combining facial recognition and emotion analysis into a single device powered by Raspberry Pi. The device captures pictures, processes the data, and provides insights into detected faces and emotions. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Detects multiple faces in images.
- Identifies individuals based on trained datasets.
- Recognizes emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) using CNNs.
- Displays analyzed results with visual and numerical outputs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanskriti-Slngh/Emotion-and-Facial-Recognition.git
   cd Emotion-and-Facial-Recognition
